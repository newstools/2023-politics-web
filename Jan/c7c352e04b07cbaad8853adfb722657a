DA condemns De Ruyter murder attempt 07 January 2023 The DA condemns the attempted murder of Eskom’s CEO, Andre de Ruyter at Megawatt Park, while he was dutifully attending to his duties in the wake of his resignation – thrust upon him by factions in the ANC as part of an ostensible deal to secure president Ramaphosa another term in power. Not only has de Ruyter been left out to dry amidst ANC shenanigans but now criminal syndicates within Eskom are palpably hell-bent on cementing their stranglehold on Eskom that is destroying the economy. It is clear that they will stop at nothing. All this – worthy of a mafia movie – now plays out while the ANC does nothing to secure our electricity supply despite DA requests to take decisive action. Loadshedding – rolling blackouts – continue to hobble the economy and have become an embedded feature in the daily lives of millions of South Africans. When is this going to end? We cannot wait until 2024 when the criminal syndicate that is the ANC is removed from power. Firm and decisive action needs to be taken now. The trouble is that anyone who attempts to do so is not only sidelined, but their lives are in danger. The DA calls on president Ramaphosa to outline to the nation exactly what is being done to address this mayhem? He needs to do so immediately and must be held to account for every act of omission or commission that has brought us to this sorry state of affairs. The DA will write to the president to demand action on this without delay. Statement issued by Ghaleb Cachalia MP - DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, 7 July 2023
