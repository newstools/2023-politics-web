EFF condemns right-wing coup attempt in Brazil that seeks to undermine the democratic election of President Lula Da Silva  9 January 2023 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) condemns the attempted coup d'état in Brazil, which is inspired and sponsored by the former right-wing President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. Having fled to the United States of America after being defeated by the progressive leader President Luiz lnåcio Lula da Silva in the recent elections in Brazil, Bolsonaro has drawn inspiration from the undemocratic right in the USA, who stormed the Capitol after the defeat of Donald Trump. The supporters of the cowardly puppet of imperialism Bolsonaro, who refuse to accept the democratic outcome of the recent elections in Brazil stormed the Presidential Palace, Congress and Supreme Court of Brazil in an act which is a spit in the face of democracy and is typical of right-wingers in Latin America. The act which sought to undermine the Presidency of Lula Da Silva was decisively defeated and order and calm has been restored in Brazil. The EFF commends the law enforcement agencies of Brazil and President Lula for handling this clear provocation in a dignified manner in which there was no loss of life and arrests were made swiftly. This is yet another indicator that the claims against President Lula as being dictatorial are baseless, as he has handled his victory with humility and the constant provocation from his opponents with patience. The new era in Brazil must be defended and supported by all peace-loving and democratic nations of the world. There is no place for the antics of Bolsonaro and his irrational supporters in any democratic dispensation and he must be investigated for his role in an attempted coup in Brazil.
