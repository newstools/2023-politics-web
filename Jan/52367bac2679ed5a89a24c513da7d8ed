DA to submit parliamentary question over spike in murders in Estcourt  9 January 2023 The DA in uThukela will this month submit a parliamentary question to Bheki Cele, the Minister of Police, to establish what progress has been made to charge the perpetrators of murders in Estcourt over the past five years. This as the number of murders seemingly continues to spike, this includes the drive by shooting in the middle of Estcourt town last week that resulted in two deaths. The repeated incidents of shootings and murders in Estcourt are to be condemned in the strongest terms. The question remains, why it seems that none of the perpetrators of these murders in public places in Estcourt during daylight with thousands of lives put at risk have been charged, convicted and sent to prison for life? What action have the police taken to collect evidence and make arrests? It cannot be business as usual when perpetrators are roaming our communities freely at the cost of residents. What plan does Bheki Cele have to keep our Escourt communities safe? Issued by Alf Lees, DA uThukela Constituency Head, 9 January 2023
